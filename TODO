Things To Do:

Information tab - refresh button on the toolbar?

Could handle man pages from the file list
And other file types too

Faulty zfs pools should be marked in red
Need a way to filter displayed output. Could use that to toggle
zfs snapshots on or off, or disabled services

Views aren't dynamic and don't refresh - for example if a zone is added
or removed or changes state (or reboots, as zoneid changes)

Update arcstat

Update freechart

Network view - relationship between physical interfaces, vnics, aggregations
  and what they're connected to

SMF - use jna (like haplo does)

top: jkstat + jproc; graphical charts and sparks for summaries; add
zone/user/whatever aggregation

ZFS: need to display snapshots

Should Mnttab be singleton?
Would make it easier to query from any context without having to
pass around.

Mnttab should update itself to allow for mount and unmount activity

Save historical kstat data so that the charts don't start blank
each time?

Threaded cores and individual threads should show their fragment of the
psrinfo output

Threads and cores should say what their parent is
