Things To Do:

Information tab - refresh button on the toolbar?

Could handle man pages from the file list
And other file types too

Need a way to filter displayed output. Could use that to toggle
zfs snapshots on or off, or disabled services

Views aren't dynamic and don't refresh - for example if a zone is added
or removed or changes state (or reboots, as zoneid changes)

Network view - relationship between physical interfaces, vnics, aggregations
  and what they're connected to

SMF - use jna (like haplo does)

top: jkstat + jproc; graphical charts and sparks for summaries; add
zone/user/whatever aggregation

ZFS:
Need to display snapshots
Track what volumes are used for
Faulty pools should be marked
Update arcstat

Save historical kstat data so that the charts don't start blank
each time?
