Things To Do:

Zones
  Add a net widget for exclusive-ip zones
    It's halfway implemented
    Need to pass the kstat and jkstat through somehow
    Handle potential multiple interfaces

Could handle man pages from the file list
And other file types too

java -cp lib/java/illuminate.jar org.tribblix.illuminate.helpers.ManViewer zfs.1m

Make a standalone man viewer

Faulty zfs pools should be marked in red
Need a way to filter displayed output. Could use that to toggle
zfs snapshots on or off, or disabled services

The tree cell renderers don't actually do tooltips
(It's not obvious they should, fix the comment.)
Or give SysItem a tooltip method (that ought to be dynamic)

Views aren't dynamic and don't refresh - for example if a zone is added
or removed or changes state (or reboots, as zoneid changes)

Update arcstat

Update freechart

Network view - relationship between physical interfaces, vnics, aggregations
  and what they're connected to

Replace pixmaps (and their names)

The zone information could add a link to the relevant brand man page

Command output could add a link to the relevant man page

SMF - use jna (like haplo does)

cfgadm

top: jkstat + jproc; graphical charts and sparks for summaries; add
zone/user/whatever aggregation

ZFS: need to display snapshots

Should Mnttab be singleton?
Would make it easier to query from any context without having to
pass around.

Mnttab should update itself to allow for mount and unmount activity

Save historical kstat data so that the charts don't start blank
each time?

Threaded cores and individual threads should show their fragment of the
psrinfo output

Threads and cores should say what their parent is
