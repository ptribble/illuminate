<h1>Tribblix Package Viewer</h1>

<p>The Package Viewer allows you to study the SVR4 packages
installed on your system.</p>

<p>There are 3 available views:
<ul>
<li>The Package List tab shows the packages installed, initially in
alphabetical order of package name, although you can change the sort
order using the column headers.</li>
<li>The Overlays tab shows the available overlays, their constituent
packages, and whether they're installed.</li>
<li>The Filesystem tab allows you to browse the filesystem and see
which packages and overlays contain a file.</li>
</ul>
The above views give general information on the package, the other
packages it depends on and which depend on it, and which overlays
the package is contained in.
