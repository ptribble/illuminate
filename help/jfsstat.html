<h1>JFSstat</h1>

<p>JFSstat is a tabular display of the filesystem statistics kept by
illumos. It uses the same kstats as the fsstat command line utility.</p>

<p>The available kstats are extensive, and only a subset can be
displayed at any time. Use the "Display" menu to choose which set of
statistics to display.</p>

<p>The rows can be sorted by selecting the column header.</p>

<h2>The toolbar</h2>

<p>The toolbar contains a small number of menus.</p>

<ul>

<li>File - allows you to exit jfsstat.</li>

<li>Update every - allows you to change how rapidly the statistics are
updated.</li>

<li>Help - shows this help file, and the CDDL license that this
software is licensed under.</li>

<li>Display - allows you to select which statistics (in other words,
which filesystem operations) are shown.</p>

<li>Show - allows you to toggle the display of hidden filesystems and
aggregates by filesystem type. By default, hidden filesystems and
aggregates aren't shown.</p>
</ul>
