<h1>illuminate Services View</h1>

<p>The illuminate services view allows you to see which services (managed
by SMF, the Service Management Facility) are running on your system.</p>

<p>The left hand pane shows the services that are running, either as a
simple linear list or as a tree view. The tree view is based solely on
the service names, and implies no relationship or dependency between
services.</p>

<p>The right hand pane shows three tabs:
<ul>
<li>Status - shows whether the service is running, and if so, the
processes associated with the service.</li>
<li>Dependencies - lists services that the service depends on, and
which services depend on the service.
<li>Log file - if available, the log file associated with the service
can be accessed.</li>
</ul></p>
